# Search_TopResults

You can run the app by using the streamlit run command in your command line, followed by the name of the python file that contains the app.

For example, if your file is called "septic_repair_search.py", you can run the app by executing the following command in your command line/terminal:


streamlit run septic_repair_search.py
Make sure that you have streamlit installed in your system, if not, you can install it via pip


pip install streamlit
Once you run the command, Streamlit will start a local development server and launch the app in your default web browser. You should see the UI of the app, where you can input your search query and retrieve the search results.

You can interact with the app and make searches, after you run the script on your machine, a web page will open on your browser with the UI of the app.

You also must have a valid google api key and cx(custom search id) otherwise the search won't work and you may see an error message.
